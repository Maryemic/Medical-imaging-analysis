# Medical-imaging-analysis
The project  aims to explore the standard DICOM format and different techniques for processing retinal images. The project is divided into eight sections, starting with an introduction to the topic.
In section II, the standard DICOM format is discussed, which is widely used in medical imaging. Section III focuses on the extraction of different data from the retinal images. The characteristics of the images, such as color and resolution, are discussed in section IV.
Section V covers the visualization of the retinal image in 2D, while section VI discusses the histogram of the image. Section VII explores the different morphological transformations and filters that can be applied to retinal images.
The project concludes with section VIII, which summarizes the findings and discusses the potential applications of the techniques discussed in the report.
Overall, this project provides a comprehensive overview of the different techniques for processing retinal images and highlights the importance of standard formats and image processing in the field of biomedical imaging.
